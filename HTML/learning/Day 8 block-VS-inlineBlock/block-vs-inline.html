    <!-- Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. There are two display values: block and inline.

1) Block level elements: 
             A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
             A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

            <address>  <article>  <aside>  <blockquote>  <canvas>  <dd>  <div>  <dl>  <dt>  <fieldset>  <figcaption>  <figure>  <footer>  <form>
            <h1>-<h6>  <header>  <hr>  <li>  <main>  <nav>  <noscript>  <ol>  <p>  <pre>  <section>  <table>  <tfoot>  <ul>  <video>

2) Inline Elements:
            An inline element does not start on a new line.
            An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            |  ** NOTE: Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!   |
