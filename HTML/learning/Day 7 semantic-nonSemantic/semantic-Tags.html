Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. 
For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain.
On the other hand, tags like<div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements. They serve only as content holders but give no indication as to what type of content they contain or what role that content plays on the page.


A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
