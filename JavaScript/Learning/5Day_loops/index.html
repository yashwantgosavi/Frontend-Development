        --== while statement ==-- 
        The while statement executes the statements until the condition is not false. The
        syntax for 'while' loop is -

        while (condition) {
        ...STATEMENTS...
        }

        First, the condition is evaluated and if it is true, then the statements are executed
        and again the condition is tested. The execution stops when the condition returns
        false.


            **NOTE: You have to provide an update expression inside the loop, so that it does not
            repeat infinitely.


        --== do...while statement ==--
        The do-while loop is similar to while loop, except that the statements are executed
        at least once. The syntax for 'do-while' loop is

        do {
        ...STATEMENTS...
        } 
        while (condition);

        First, the statements are executed without checking the condition. After that the
        condition is checked and if it is true the statements are executed again.
