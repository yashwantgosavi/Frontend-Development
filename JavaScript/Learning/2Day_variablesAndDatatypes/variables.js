/*

###  variables ###
const, var, let

we can used only this special characters when we will write variables name: numbers, $, -, alphabets
  - it can't start with number
  - it can start with $, myName
  - for best practices we will use reletable word for variables name
  - camel casing and snake casing



  *let and const (ES6)
  1) let:
        declaration : let age;  
                      age = 10;

            - we can assign value later
            - we can declared variables without values
            - we can't same variable later
  2) var:
        

  3) const:
        - we will use const for constant values.
        - we need to give some value.
