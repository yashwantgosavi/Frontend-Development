        we have many elements that we will access with different document methods. When we render the file in a browser, it will look similar to this:
            1. Now you have to access a single element in the DOM by its unique ID and change the border property to green.
            2. We have two elements with a demo class in the given file. Access elements and put them in a variable. for accessing the element you can't use getElementsByClassName.
            3. You have now selected every element on the page that has a demo class and changed the border property to blue.
            4. You must change the second text element to "Second Elements of Class".
            Expected Output:

    <h1>Accessing Elements in the DOM</h1>
    <h2>ID</h2>
    <p id="green">Access me by ID</p>
    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p class="demo">Don't access me by document.getElementByClassName(1)</p>
    <p class="demo">Don't access me by document.getElementByClassName(2)</p>
